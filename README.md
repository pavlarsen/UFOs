# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project

### This project has the purpose of creating a webpage for UFO sighting fans. The idea is that any informed viewer could be able to filter registered and certified UFO sightings according to specific date, city, state, country or even shape of the UFO. This project was made with HTML webpage formating and for programming the filtering function, and analysis of data I use Javascript coding. For special formating of the page, I implemented a CSS code for a more appealing page.

How tu use:

Once you reach UFO Finder, you will land in this page:

![Webpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113866707/208001211-7d1dd418-ad85-4c71-824e-5a7797045156.png)

Here, UFO fans would be able to filter UFO sightings from the data table that is displayed. To perform any filter, users can either filter by date, city, state, country or UFO shape (either individually or performing several filters).

In the following example, we entered a filter for "El Cajon" city on "1/1/2010". In order to clear the filters, users must update the web browser.

Regarding the inside engines for the webpage to work:

The following is the HTML code that showcases the Filter Box with the different parameters to filter data.

The next code is where the magic happens. Here you can see the Javascript code I used in order to perform the filtering of data according to the user input:

## Summary

- One drawback from the page is that in order to clear the current filters entered, the user has to press "update" webpage in order to have a fresh view. Additionally, I would recommend to make a list to choose values from the filter search, so users can identify what options are available. 

- Adding pictures of the shape of the UFO sighting and being able to see them once the information is filtered would enhance the experience for the user.

- Adding a comment segment would make it possible for UFO fans to interact and exchange more relevant data that could attract more fans.
