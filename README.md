# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project

### This project has the purpose of creating a webpage for UFO sighting fans. The idea is that any informed viewer could be able to filter registered and certified UFO sightings according to specific date, city, state, country or even shape of the UFO. This project was made with HTML webpage formating and for programming the filtering function, and analysis of data I use Javascript coding. For special formating of the page, I implemented a CSS code for a more appealing page.

## Summary

- One drawback from the page is that in order to clear the current filters entered, the user has to press "update" webpage in order to have a fresh view. 

- Adding pictures of the shape of the UFO sighting and being able to see them once the information is filtered would enhance the experience for the user.

- Adding a comment segment would make it possible for UFO fans to interact and exchange more relevant data that could attract more fans.
